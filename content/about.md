## Jordan Duabe --- `@j4ckofalltrades`

I'm a programmer, Linux geek, and command-line ninja from the :philippines:,
currently based in :australia:.

The majority of my work experience has been writing code for web and mobile
apps in a variety of programming languages and frameworks but I've also worked
on DevOps-related stuff like setting up server environments and CI/CD pipelines.

When I'm not writing code -- I'm either playing DotA or gaming on the Switch,
tinkering with Raspberry Pi's, or learning to play the ukulele.

Outside of tech, I'm also into:

- Mechanical keyboards :keyboard:
- Sneakers :athletic_shoe:
- Alternative music scene :metal: :guitar: :drum:
