> Sized just right at a 75%—a compact configuration to feature the top function row — the ID80 mechanical keyboard kit from IDOBAO makes a great fit on any desk. This board is both durable and easy to build. Its PCB also features Kailh hot-swap sockets, which allow users to quickly change switches without a soldering.
> Featuring a seamless case design made from anodized aluminum, it also incorporates an integrated plate which holds switches in place. QMK programmable for custom key commands, and outfitted with a USB-C port for fast connectivity, this board is ready for work or play.

The 75% is a very popular keyboard layout, in part to its aesthetic and also functional -- just a tad bit wider than a 65% but with a full function row. The function row is especially enticing to me as most IDE shortcuts require function keys, and I don't really use the arrow keys or the navigation cluster all that much.

I went for a clean, simple aesthetic for this build; an all black build with the aluminimum case and **ePBT Black on White** keycaps.

Used the highly rated **Boba U4T** switches, and **Durock v2** stabilizers for this build, both lubed with **Krytox 205g0**.

Custom keymap not too far off from the default / standard 75% layout, just had a couple of small quality of life modifications:

- Soft escape (Esc when help, Ctrl when tapped)
- Media controls on layer 1
