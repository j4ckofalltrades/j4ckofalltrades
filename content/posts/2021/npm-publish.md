![npm](https://res.cloudinary.com/j4ckofalltrades/image/upload/w_1000/v1633760759/blog/publish-guides/npm-publish_ssmdeh.png)

This guide walks you through the necessary steps to upload your package to the
[npm registry](https://npmjs.com) with some recommendations along the way.

## Setup npm account

1. Register for an [npm account](https://npmjs.com/signup)

2. Test your account by logging in using `npm`  

   ```sh
   # you should be prompted for your username, password, and email address
   # and an OTP if you've enabled 2FA
   $ npm login
   
   # this should print out your npm username
   $ npm whoami
   ```

## Dry-run (Testing your package locally)

Test out your package locally to ensure that everything works before publihsing
it to the npm registry. You can do this by invoking `npm install` and providing
the path to your package e.g.:

`$ npm install /path/to/your/package`

Another thing to do is to review the contents of the published package to make
sure that it doesn't include any sensitive or unnecessary information. You can
perform a `dry-run` with:

```sh
$ npm publish --dry-run

# output should look something like
npm notice 
npm notice <package_name@version>
npm notice === Tarball Contents === 
npm notice <tarball_contents_here>
npm notice === Tarball Details === 
npm notice <tarball_details_here>
npm notice 
+ <package_name@version>
```

Additionally you can create a `.npmignore` file to exclude files that you don't
want to publish to the registry.

## Publishing to the npm registry

In your package's root directory, execute:

`$ npm publish`

If publishing a scoped public package, execute:

`$ npm publish --access public`

When the publish process finishes, you should be able to see your public
package page at npmjs.com/package/your-package-name.

Congrats, you've successfully published your package to the npm registry. :tada:

## Bonus: Automation with GitHub Packages

You'll probably want to automate this process as part of your CI/CD pipeline.
Here's how to set it up using GitHub Actions.

1. Create a [new npm access token](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens)

2. Add the access token as a secret to your target GitHub repository. You can
find this under Settings > Secrets for your repo. Give the secret a name e.g.
`NPM_TOKEN`.

3. Create a GitHub action workflow file in your repo at
`.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml` with the following contents:

    ```yaml
    name: Publish package to npm

    on:
    release:
        types: [created]
    
    jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        permissions:
        contents: read
        packages: write
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
            with:
            node-version: '14.x'
            registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org'
        - run: npm install
        - run: npm test
        - run: npm run build
        # Publish to npm (append `--access public` for scoped packages)
        - run: npm publish
            env:
            NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
    ```

    This workflow is triggered when a new release is created but you can also
    configure it to be triggered when a different event happens e.g. when a
    new tag gets pushed. Refer to the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) 
    for more configuration options.

    That's it, time to get publishing.
