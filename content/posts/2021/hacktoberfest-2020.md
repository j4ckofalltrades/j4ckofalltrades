This one's long overdue and when the swag arrived last week I figured I really
need to get this done.

The past year has been tough to say the least and getting to write code for
fun while helping out the open-source community was a very welcome distraction.

Though I have been programming for a while this was my first time participating
in Hacktoberfest and contributing to open-source in general, it was nice to
get to talk to and interact with maintainers and other like-minded individuals
who are passionate about code and giving back to the community.

Even with all the drama that surrounded this past year's iteration I'd say this
was a positive experience overall, and I look forward to joining this year's
iteration.

Here are some of the projects I found interesting and contributed to (and still
try to contribute to):

Happy hacking!
