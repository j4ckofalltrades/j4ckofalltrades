      <description>Jordan Duabe &amp;mdash; @j4ckofalltrades I&amp;rsquo;m a programmer, Linux geek, and command-line ninja from the ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ (now based in ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º).
I loved video games (still do) as a kid and that&amp;rsquo;s what got me into computers, programming, and tech in general. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a software engineer for the past couple of years with experience in web and mobile app development in a variety of programming languages and frameworks. I&amp;rsquo;ve also picked up some DevOps skills and tricks over the years; from writing shell scripts to setting up CI/CD pipelines.</description>

      <description>Happy Halloween ðŸŽƒ ðŸ¦‡ ðŸ‘»
Obligatory first post while getting everything set up, as you&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen in the blog footer this website is powered by Hugo with the Hugo-Coder theme and is hosted on GitHub.
It&amp;rsquo;s really nice not having to worry about stylesheets and layouts because I have close to zero design skills and being able to just write stuff in Markdown is great.
Not really sure why I wanted to start a blog ðŸ¤” but here we are.</description>
